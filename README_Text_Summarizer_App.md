# üß† Text Summarizer App (Abstractive, Transformer-Based)

An **abstractive text summarization app** built using a **Transformer model (facebook/bart-large-cnn)**.  
This project automatically generates concise summaries from long articles using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.  
It includes a notebook for model exploration and a Streamlit-based front-end for deployment.

## üß© Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a complete abstractive text summarization system using Hugging Face Transformers.  
It covers everything from model loading and dataset preparation to evaluation and dashboard visualization.

The summarizer compresses text while preserving meaning ‚Äî not by extracting sentences, but by generating new ones that capture the essence of the source content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Transformer-based abstractive summarization (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)  
- Evaluation dashboard with readability and compression metrics  
- Interactive Streamlit app for text summarization  
- Dataset loading from Hugging Face (`cnn_dailymail`)  
- Metrics tracking (compression ratio, word count, summary quality)

## üìä Evaluation Dashboard

| Metric | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Compression Ratio** | Original length vs summary length |
| **Readability Score** | Evaluates how easy the summary is to read |
| **Summary Length** | Word count of generated summaries |
| **ROUGE Score** | Measures overlap between generated and reference summaries |
